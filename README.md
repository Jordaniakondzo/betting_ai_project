# Match Prediction and Betting Recommendations

# Overview
This project is designed to predict the outcomes of matches using advanced machine learning algorithms. Our goal is to not only predict the outcome of a game (win, loss, or draw) but also to provide recommendations for betting based on the predicted probabilities.

## Key Features:
Predict Match Outcome: Uses trained machine learning models to predict whether a match will end in a win, loss, or draw.

Betting Recommendations: Based on predicted probabilities, the system gives betting advice such as "Recommended", "Suspicious", or "Dangerous".

## Architecture
The project is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity and scalability. Here's a brief overview of the classes:

. BaseModel: A foundational class that provides basic methods for training, prediction, and evaluation. All other model classes inherit from this base.

. RandomForestModel and XGBoostModel: These are the core classes implementing the Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms, respectively. They contain parameters and methods specific to each algorithm.

. MatchPredictor: This class acts as a facilitator. It uses trained models to make predictions and then fetches the relevant betting recommendations.

### Setup and Execution
# Prerequisites:
# Python 3.x
# Python Libraries:
    scikit-learn
    pandas
    xgboost
    joblib
pip install scikit-learn pandas xgboost joblib

#### Data
Ensure that data files (X_test_saved.csv, X_train_saved.csv, y_test_saved.csv, y_train_saved.csv) are present in the project directory. This data is vital for training and testing the models.

##### Running the Application:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the script:
python [filename].py
The trained models are stored in serialized files, making it easier to reuse them without retraining. This ensures both efficiency and consistency in predictions.

###### Workflow:

1. Initialization: Two models, RandomForestModel and XGBoostModel, are initialized.

2. Training: Both models are trained using the training dataset. The best hyperparameters are selected via grid search cross-validation. This guarantees optimal performance for each model.

3. Prediction & Recommendation: The MatchPredictor class utilizes the trained models to predict match outcomes for the test dataset. Furthermore, based on the probabilities generated, it provides betting recommendations.

###### Interpretation of Betting Recommendations:
* Recommended: A high level of confidence that the outcome predicted is accurate. Suitable for placing bets.

* Suspicious: An intermediate confidence level. Caution is advised.

* Dangerous: A low confidence level in the predicted outcome. It's better to refrain from betting based on this recommendation.

###### Future Enhancements:

1. Data Enhancement: Incorporate more features, such as player statistics, weather conditions, or historical match outcomes to improve prediction accuracy.

2. Model Expansion: Add more machine learning algorithms or deep learning architectures to compare performances and select the best.

3. User Interface: Develop a web-based or mobile application to provide users with real-time predictions and recommendations.
